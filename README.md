Hey there! Short README right here.
This is a school project i am involved with which i used to learn also html and css.
the objective is to make a website for the project that will display the work of my class!

Unfortunately i am new to html and css so the website will look like a word document basically ðŸ˜­

As for the source code:
The html and css code is entirely Open Source under the ***BSD-3-Clause** License*. See LICENSE
The media in the website will be under creative commons by attribution 

That's about it! Feel free to look at the html and css, use it in case somehow you find a purpose for this, have a great day!
